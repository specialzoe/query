#### Java Edition (1.7+)
This is a python module for the minecraft java query protocol which implements methods for the basic stat and full stat requests as described on https://minecraft.wiki/w/Query and returns the structured reply in a dictionary.
For access to e.g. a server icon you will need to use the Server List Ping, which is NOT part of this module. (https://minecraft.wiki/w/Java_Edition_protocol/Server_List_Ping)

You may be interested in https://github.com/py-mine/mcstatus if you want complete functionality across versions.
